# Wacht

Simple distributed uptime monitoring, built in the EU.

> **Status:** Early development. Nothing is deployable yet.

## What it will do

- Run HTTP, TCP, and DNS checks from multiple probe locations
- Reduce false alerts using quorum-based alerting — a check only pages you if multiple probes agree it is down
- Host a public status page for your services
- Send alerts via webhooks
- Keep all monitoring data in infrastructure you control

## Self-host

_Coming soon. Will be a single `docker compose up`._
